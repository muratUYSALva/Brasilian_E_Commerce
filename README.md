# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

Welcome to the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. This dataset contains information on 100,000 orders placed at the Olist Store in Brazil. The data covers orders made from 2016 to 2018 through various marketplaces. It provides a comprehensive view of each order, including order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer location, product details, and reviews written by customers.

In addition to the main dataset, we have also made available a geolocation dataset that correlates Brazilian zip codes with latitude and longitude coordinates.

Please note that this dataset is real commercial data, but it has been anonymized to protect privacy. Any references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses for confidentiality.
